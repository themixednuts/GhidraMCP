> Ghidra integration for the Model Context Protocol (MCP)

A Ghidra extension that runs an embedded MCP server to expose Ghidra program data and functionalities via tools.

---

## ‚ú® Features

This extension exposes various Ghidra functionalities to MCP clients. For convenience and to manage client-side tool limits, related operations are often bundled into `grouped` tools, accessible via the category links below.

> [!TIP]
> While individual tools are available, this extension also provides `grouped` tools (linked in the category headers below). These grouped tools allow clients to perform multiple related operations in a single call, which can be more efficient and help manage limits on the number of enabled tools some MCP clients might have. Both grouped tools and individual operations can be enabled or disabled via the GhidraMCP extension options within Ghidra's main Tool Options.

### [`Project Management`](src/main/java/com/themixednuts/tools/grouped/GroupedProjectManagementOperationsTool.java)

Provides tools for managing Ghidra project context, including listing open files, getting current program information, handling bookmarks, and interacting with Ghidra scripts.

### [`Functions`](src/main/java/com/themixednuts/tools/grouped/GroupedFunctionOperationsTool.java)

Offers a comprehensive suite of tools for inspecting, creating, deleting, and modifying functions within a program. This includes managing function names, prototypes, comments, and symbols within functions.

### [`Symbols & Labels`](src/main/java/com/themixednuts/tools/grouped/GroupedSymbolOperationsTool.java)

Enables interaction with various symbols and labels in Ghidra. Tools cover listing defined strings, managing namespaces, setting/getting comments at addresses, renaming data, and handling labels.

### [`Data Types`](src/main/java/com/themixednuts/tools/grouped/GroupedDatatypeOperationsTool.java)

Allows for detailed management of data types within Ghidra's data type manager. This includes listing, creating, modifying, and deleting categories, structures, enums, unions, typedefs, and function definitions, as well as applying types to specific addresses.

### [`Memory & Addresses`](src/main/java/com/themixednuts/tools/grouped/GroupedMemoryOperationsTool.java)

Facilitates direct interaction with program memory. Tools include listing memory segments, reading/writing bytes (patching), searching memory, and retrieving cross-references (XRefs) to and from addresses, as well as listing imports.

### [`Decompiler`](src/main/java/com/themixednuts/tools/grouped/GroupedDecompilerOperationsTool.java)

Provides access to Ghidra's decompiler capabilities, primarily for decompiling functions to view their C-like representation and P-code.

### [`Control Flow`](src/main/java/com/themixednuts/tools/grouped/GroupedControlFlowOperationsTool.java)

Includes tools for analyzing program control flow, such as retrieving information about basic blocks and their predecessors/successors.

### Analysis & Scripting

Contains tools related to Ghidra's analysis capabilities.

- Trigger auto-analysis: Allows programmatic initiation of Ghidra's auto-analysis process for a program via [`GhidraTriggerAutoAnalysisTool`](src/main/java/com/themixednuts/tools/projectmanagement/GhidraTriggerAutoAnalysisTool.java).

## üöÄ Installation

1.  Download the latest release `zip` file from the [Releases](https://github.com/themixednuts/GhidraMCP/releases) page.
2.  In Ghidra, go to `File` -> `Install Extensions...`.
3.  Click the `+` button (Add extension) in the top right corner.
4.  Navigate to the downloaded `zip` file and select it.
5.  Ensure the `GhidraMCP` extension is checked in the list and click `OK`.
6.  Restart Ghidra.

---

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Usage

1.  Ensure Ghidra is running with the GhidraMCP extension active.
2.  Ensure your MCP Client is configured to connect to the GhidraMCP server (see 'Configuring an MCP Client' below).

## üõ†Ô∏è Building from Source

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/themixednuts/GhidraMCP.git
    ```
2.  Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd GhidraMCP
    ```
3.  Ensure you have [Apache Maven](https://maven.apache.org/install.html) and a JDK (compatible version, e.g., JDK 21 or later recommended for modern Ghidra development) installed.
4.  Copy the following required JAR files from your Ghidra installation directory into the `lib/` directory of this project. Create the `lib/` directory if it doesn't exist:
    - `Ghidra/Features/Base/lib/Base.jar`
    - `Ghidra/Features/Decompiler/lib/Decompiler.jar`
    - `Ghidra/Framework/Docking/lib/Docking.jar`
    - `Ghidra/Framework/Generic/lib/Generic.jar`
    - `Ghidra/Framework/Project/lib/Project.jar`
    - `Ghidra/Framework/SoftwareModeling/lib/SoftwareModeling.jar`
    - `Ghidra/Framework/Utility/lib/Utility.jar`
    - `Ghidra/Framework/Gui/lib/Gui.jar`
      > [!NOTE]
      > Paths are relative to your Ghidra installation folder. Exact paths might vary slightly based on Ghidra version and OS.
5.  Build the project using Maven:
    ```bash
    mvn clean package assembly:single
    ```
6.  The installable `zip` file will be located in the `target/` directory (e.g., `target/GhidraMCP-*-SNAPSHOT-ghidra.zip`). Follow the Installation steps above using this file.

## üîå Configuring an MCP Client

To allow an MCP client (like Claude Desktop or a custom client) to interact with Ghidra via this extension, you need to configure the client to connect to the server endpoint provided by GhidraMCP.

The GhidraMCP server runs within Ghidra itself when the extension is active. It typically exposes an HTTP SSE (Server-Sent Events) endpoint.

Add the following configuration to your MCP client's settings (e.g., `claude_desktop_config.json` for Claude Desktop). Adjust the key (`"ghidra"` in this example) as needed:

```json
{
	"mcpServers": {
		"ghidra": {
			"url": "http://127.0.0.1:8080/sse"
		}
		// Add other MCP server configurations here if needed
	}
}
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Port:** The default port is `8080`. This is configurable within Ghidra under the Tool Options for the GhidraMCP extension. If you change the port in Ghidra, you **must** update the `url` in your client configuration accordingly.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Server Status:** Ghidra must be running with the GhidraMCP extension enabled for the client to connect successfully.

This project is heavily inspired by and based on the work of [LaurieWired](https://github.com/LaurieWired). Instead of using a bridge, this plugin directly embeds the server in the plugin.
